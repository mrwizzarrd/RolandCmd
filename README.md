## About This Project


This project was originally going to be a small way to learn applications of function pointers, but quickly became much more than that.
As I worked on it, I learned how to structure my code, organize multiple files, document my work, and use Git for version control.
This is the first project I've been proud enough about to post publicly, because of how much I learned while working on it and how far it's come.
