## About This Project


This project was originally going to be a small way to learn applications of pointers to functions, but then I started getting into it more and more, learning ways to improve my code and document it. This is my first project I actually am proud of enough to post it publicly, as I have learned so many skills from this project.



Here is a list of the things I have learned from this project:

-Function Pointer Usage

-Struct, Typedef, and Enum usage
-Git Basics

-Doxygen Code Documentation
-Modular Code Design

-Multi header code compilation using makefiles
